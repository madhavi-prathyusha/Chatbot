# Chatbot
Today, most large-scale conversational AI agents (e.g. Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant) are built using manually annotated data to train the different components of the system. Typically, the accuracy of the ML models in these components are improved by manually transcribing and annotating data. Recently, chatbots received an increased attention from industry and diverse research communities as a dialogue-based interface providing advanced human-computer interactions. Chatbots are software programs that use natural language understanding and processing. Here we are going to develop a chatbot for a college to give details about the college and also clear the queries about the college.<br/><br/>
Here I first build a database to store expected queries and responces. The contents in this json database file is preprocess with the process of tokenization and lemmatization which are in Natural Language Toolkit(nltk) library. The preprocessed contents are stored in pickle files for further use. Now I built a neural model with 3 sequential layers with relu and softmax activation layers. I optimized the gradient descent of model using Schotastic Gradient Descent(SGD) algorithm. This neural model is then trained with the preprocessed data and then model is saved in .h5 format. I now built another python file to take input from the user, proprocess the input and get the required output by passing the preprocessed input to the model.<br/><br/>
The file [intents.json](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/intents.json) is used for storing the expected queries and the responces. The file [train_chatbot.py](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/train_chatbot.py) file is used to convert data in json files and used to build a neural network model [chatbot_model.h5](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/chatbot_model.h5) and also some pickle files [classes.pkl](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/classes.pkl) and [words.pkl](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/words.pkl) for further use. The files [app.py](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/app.py) is used to take input from user, proprocess it and gets output by making use of previous built neural model. The template file [index.html](https://github.com/madhavi-prathyusha/Chatbot/blob/main/Project-Codes/index.html) is used to create a user interface with the help of html, css and java script.
